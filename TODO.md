# Performance Optimization Plan for FlowTask

## Frontend Optimizations

### 1. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- [x] Implement React.lazy() for route-based code splitting
- [ ] Add dynamic imports for heavy components (modals, charts)
- [x] Create loading components for better UX

### 2. Caching & Data Management
- [x] Implement React Query/TanStack Query for advanced caching
- [ ] Add service worker for offline capabilities
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates for better perceived performance
- [ ] Add background sync for offline actions

### 3. Rendering Optimizations
- [x] Add React.memo for expensive components
- [x] Implement virtualization for large lists (react-window)
- [x] Add debouncing for search inputs
- [ ] Optimize re-renders with useMemo and useCallback

### 4. Bundle Optimization
- [ ] Analyze bundle size with vite-bundle-analyzer
- [ ] Implement tree shaking optimizations
- [ ] Add compression and minification
- [ ] Optimize images and assets

## Backend Optimizations

### 1. Database Performance
- [ ] Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
- [ ] Implement database connection pooling
- [ ] Add query optimization and aggregation pipelines
- [ ] Implement pagination for large datasets

### 2. API Performance
- [ ] Implement response compression
- [ ] Add rate limiting optimizations
- [ ] Implement API response caching

### 3. Server Performance
- [ ] Add clustering for multi-core utilization
- [ ] Implement load balancing
- [ ] Add connection pooling for external services
- [ ] Optimize middleware order

### 4. Real-time Performance
- [ ] Optimize Socket.io connections
- [ ] Implement selective broadcasting
- [ ] Add connection pooling for Socket.io

## Infrastructure Optimizations

### 1. CDN & Static Assets
- [ ] Implement CDN for static assets
- [ ] Add asset optimization pipeline
- [ ] Implement proper caching headers

### 2. Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement error tracking
- [ ] Add analytics for user interactions
