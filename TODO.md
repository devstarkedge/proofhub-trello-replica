# Drag and Drop UI Update Implementation

## Current Issues
- After drag and drop, `loadData()` is called which fetches all data from server, causing unnecessary reloads
- UI doesn't update instantly during drag operations
- Real-time updates via WebSockets are not fully utilized for local state management

## Tasks
- [x] Modify WorkFlow.jsx to update local state optimistically instead of reloading data
- [x] Update Board.jsx drag handlers to use optimistic updates (drag handlers already use optimistic onMoveCard/onMoveList props)
- [x] Update List.jsx drag handlers to use optimistic updates (drag handlers already use optimistic onMoveCard prop)
- [x] Ensure socket events properly sync state across users
- [x] Add error handling to revert optimistic updates if API calls fail
- [ ] Test drag and drop functionality for cards and lists
- [ ] Verify real-time updates work across multiple users
